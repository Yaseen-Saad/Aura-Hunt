    "description": "As the ancient cats of old awaken, the school's grounds transform into a vast and untamed wilderness. There is nowhere safe any more, and the air is alive with the whispers of ancient energies. The Aura Master, sensing your deepest fears, sets forth a challenge: to capture a majestic cat, its fur radiating an aura of serenity and power. Your mission is to venture into this untamed expanse, locate one of these majestic felines, and gently touch its soft fur without panicking or running away. As you capture the moment on camera, your aura will be attuned to the cat's energy, granting you a deeper understanding of the delicate balance between the physical and spiritual realms. Will you rise to this challenge and break free from your fear, or will you succumb to the wilds and let fear consume you? The choice is yours.",
